# Explanation of the Matplotlib Code

This code generates a fill line plot using the `matplotlib` library in Python, which visualizes the salary differences between Python developers and all developers across different age groups.

## Code Breakdown

### Importing Libraries

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

- **matplotlib.pyplot**: A module in Matplotlib used for plotting graphs and visualizations.
- **pandas**: A data manipulation library that provides data structures like DataFrames, which are useful for handling and analyzing structured data.

### Loading the Data

```python
data_frame = pd.read_csv(r"Matplotlib\Fill_Line_Plots\Developer Salary.csv")
```

- **pd.read_csv**: Reads the CSV file containing the data and stores it in a DataFrame named `data_frame`.
- The CSV file `Developer Salary.csv` is expected to have columns like `Age`, `Python`, and `All_Devs`, which represent the age of developers, their salaries if they are Python developers, and the salaries of all developers, respectively.

### Setting the Plot Style

```python
plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")
```

- **plt.style.use**: Sets the visual style of the plot. `"fivethirtyeight"` is a predefined style that makes the plot look similar to those from the FiveThirtyEight website.

### Extracting Data for Plotting

```python
Developer_Age = data_frame["Age"]
Python_Dev_Salary = data_frame["Python"]
All_Dev_Salary = data_frame["All_Devs"]
Average_Salary = 45000
```

- **Developer_Age**: Extracts the `Age` column from the DataFrame, representing the age of developers.
- **Python_Dev_Salary**: Extracts the `Python` column, representing the salaries of Python developers.
- **All_Dev_Salary**: Extracts the `All_Devs` column, representing the salaries of all developers.
- **Average_Salary**: A variable set to 45000, representing an average salary, although it is not used in the plot.

### Plotting the Lines

```python
plt.plot(Developer_Age, Python_Dev_Salary, label="Python", ls=":", color="#603F26", lw=1.5)
plt.plot(Developer_Age, All_Dev_Salary, label="All_Dev", lw=1.5)
```

- **plt.plot**: Plots a line graph.
    - The first plot is for Python developer salaries, with a dotted line style (`ls=":"`), a specific brown color (`color="#603F26"`), and a line width of 1.5 (`lw=1.5`).
    - The second plot is for all developer salaries with a default line style and width of 1.5.

### Adding Fill Between the Lines

```python
plt.fill_between(
    Developer_Age,
    Python_Dev_Salary,
    All_Dev_Salary,
    where=(Python_Dev_Salary > All_Dev_Salary),
    interpolate=True,
    label="Above All_Dev",
    alpha=0.25,
)
plt.fill_between(
    Developer_Age,
    Python_Dev_Salary,
    All_Dev_Salary,
    where=(Python_Dev_Salary <= All_Dev_Salary),
    interpolate=True,
    label="Below All_Dev",
    alpha=0.75,
)
```

- **plt.fill_between**: Fills the area between two lines in the plot.
    - The first `fill_between` fills the area where Python developer salaries are higher than all developer salaries. The fill has a label `"Above All_Dev"` and an opacity level of 0.25 (`alpha=0.25`).
    - The second `fill_between` fills the area where Python developer salaries are lower than or equal to all developer salaries, with an opacity level of 0.75.

### Adding Titles, Labels, and Legend

```python
plt.title("Fill Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Salary")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

- **plt.title**: Sets the title of the plot to `"Fill Line Plot"`.
- **plt.xlabel**: Labels the x-axis as `"Age"`.
- **plt.ylabel**: Labels the y-axis as `"Salary"`.
- **plt.legend**: Adds a legend to the plot to describe the different lines and filled areas.
- **plt.tight_layout**: Automatically adjusts subplot parameters to give specified padding.
- **plt.show**: Displays the plot.
