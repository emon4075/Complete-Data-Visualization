## Code Explanation

### Importing Libraries

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

- **`matplotlib.pyplot`** is imported as `plt` to create and customize plots and visualizations.
- **`pandas`** is imported as `pd` to handle and manipulate data, particularly for reading and processing CSV files.
- **`numpy`** is imported as `np` for numerical operations and to work with arrays.

### Setting Plot Style

```python
plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")
```

- **`plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")`** applies the "fivethirtyeight" style to the plot. This style is inspired by the design of the FiveThirtyEight website, known for its clean and readable visualizations.

### Reading Data from CSV

```python
data_frame = pd.read_csv(r"Matplotlib\Histogram_Plot\olympics_dataset.csv")
participating_year = data_frame["Year"]
participating_year = np.array(participating_year)
```

- **`pd.read_csv()`** reads the data from the CSV file located at `"Matplotlib\Histogram_Plot\olympics_dataset.csv"` and stores it in a DataFrame called `data_frame`.
- **`participating_year = data_frame["Year"]`** extracts the "Year" column from the DataFrame.
- **`participating_year = np.array(participating_year)`** converts the extracted column into a NumPy array to facilitate numerical operations and plotting.

### Defining Bins

```python
bins = list(range(1896, 2024, 4))
# bins = [1896, 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024]
median_year = 1960
```

- **`bins = list(range(1896, 2024, 4))`** creates a list of bin edges starting from 1896 to 2024, with a step of 4 years. This means each bin covers a 4-year interval, which is typical for Olympic years.
- **The commented line** provides an alternative way to manually specify the bins. It includes each year explicitly from 1896 to 2024, but the `range()` function approach is more concise and easier to maintain.
- **`median_year = 1960`** sets the median year to 1960, which will be used to add a vertical line in the histogram for reference.

### Plotting the Histogram

```python
plt.hist(
    participating_year,
    bins=bins,
    edgecolor="black",
    alpha=0.75,
    # log=True,
)
```

- **`plt.hist()`** creates a histogram of the `participating_year` data:
  - **`bins=bins`** specifies the bin edges defined earlier.
  - **`edgecolor="black"`** adds a black border around each bar in the histogram to make them more distinct.
  - **`alpha=0.75`** sets the transparency of the bars to 75%, allowing some background grid lines or other elements to be visible through the bars.
  - **The commented line** **`log=True`** would plot the histogram with a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. This is useful if the data spans several orders of magnitude or if you want to visualize relative frequencies more clearly. It is not active in the current code.

### Adding a Vertical Line

```python
plt.axvline(median_year, color="#3EC70B", lw=2, label="Year Median")
```

- **`plt.axvline()`** adds a vertical line at the `median_year` (1960):
  - **`color="#3EC70B"`** sets the line color to green.
  - **`lw=2`** sets the line width to 2 pixels, making it slightly thicker for better visibility.
  - **`label="Year Median"`** provides a label for the vertical line that will appear in the legend.

### Adding Labels and Title

```python
plt.xlabel("Olympic Year")
plt.ylabel("Participation")
plt.title("Histogram Plotting")
```

- **`plt.xlabel()`** sets the x-axis label to "Olympic Year," indicating what is represented on the x-axis.
- **`plt.ylabel()`** sets the y-axis label to "Participation," indicating what is represented on the y-axis.
- **`plt.title()`** sets the title of the plot to "Histogram Plotting," providing a description of the plot's content.

### Displaying the Legend and Plot

```python
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

- **`plt.legend()`** displays the legend on the plot, which includes the label for the vertical line ("Year Median").
- **`plt.tight_layout()`** adjusts the layout to ensure that labels, titles, and other plot elements fit well within the figure area, reducing overlap and improving readability.
- **`plt.show()`** displays the final plot, making it visible on the screen.

## Conclusion

This script creates a histogram that visualizes the distribution of Olympic participation years. It uses a custom style for aesthetics, defines bins for grouping years, adds a reference line for the median year, and customizes plot labels and titles to provide clear and informative visualizations. The commented lines offer options for additional customization, such as adjusting the bin edges and using logarithmic scaling.
