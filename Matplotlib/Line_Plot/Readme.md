## Code Explanation

### Importing Libraries

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

- `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt` for creating plots and visualizations.
- `pandas` is imported as `pd` for handling and manipulating the data, particularly reading data from a CSV file.

### Reading Data from CSV

```python
data_frame = pd.read_csv("Matplotlib\Line_Plot\IPL.csv")
```

- `pd.read_csv()` reads the data from the CSV file located at `"Matplotlib\Line_Plot\IPL.csv"` and stores it in a DataFrame called `data_frame`.

### Style Customization

```python
# print(plt.style.available)
plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")
# plt.xkcd()
```

- `print(plt.style.available)` is a commented-out line that would print all the available styles in Matplotlib. Uncommenting this line can help you see the styles you can apply.
- `plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")` applies the "fivethirtyeight" style to the plot, giving it a specific look.
- `plt.xkcd()` is a commented-out line that, if uncommented, would give the plot a hand-drawn, comic style using the "xkcd" style. This line is optional and is not active in the current code.

### Selecting Data

```python
teams = data_frame["team"][:7]
home_wins = data_frame["home_wins"][:7]
away_wins = data_frame["away_wins"][:7]
```

- `teams`, `home_wins`, and `away_wins` variables are extracted from the DataFrame. These variables contain the first 7 rows of the corresponding columns.

### Plotting the Data

```python
plt.plot(
    teams,
    home_wins,
    marker="o",
    linewidth=1,
    ls=":",
    mec="#16325B",
    mfc="#FFDC7F",
    label="Home",
    color="#A04747",
)
```

- This `plt.plot()` command plots the `home_wins` data for the teams:
  - `marker="o"` specifies a circular marker for the data points.
  - `linewidth=1` sets the thickness of the line.
  - `ls=":"` sets the line style to be dotted.
  - `mec="#16325B"` sets the marker edge color to a dark blue shade.
  - `mfc="#FFDC7F"` sets the marker face color to a light yellow shade.
  - `label="Home"` provides a label for this line in the legend.
  - `color="#A04747"` sets the line color to a reddish shade.

```python
plt.plot(
    teams,
    away_wins,
    marker=".",
    linewidth=1,
    ls="-.",
    label="Away",
    color="#0C1844",
)
```

- This `plt.plot()` command plots the `away_wins` data for the teams with:
  - `marker="."` specifies a small dot as the marker for the data points.
  - `linewidth=1`, `ls="-."`, `label="Away"`, and `color="#0C1844"` set the line properties similar to the previous plot but with different styles.

### Adding Labels and Title

```python
plt.xlabel("Teams")
plt.ylabel("Matches")
plt.title("IPL")
```

- `plt.xlabel()` sets the label for the x-axis as "Teams."
- `plt.ylabel()` sets the label for the y-axis as "Matches."
- `plt.title()` sets the title of the plot as "IPL."

### Final Plot Adjustments

```python
plt.tight_layout()
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

- `plt.tight_layout()` adjusts the padding between the plot elements for a cleaner layout.
- `plt.legend()` displays the legend on the plot, showing labels for the home and away lines.
- `plt.show()` displays the final plot on the screen.

## Conclusion

This script provides a basic line plot visualization of IPL home and away wins using Matplotlib. By customizing the plot's appearance with various styles and markers, you can create clear and informative visualizations of your data.
