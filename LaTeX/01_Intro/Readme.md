**LaTeX Code Explanation:**

```latex
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\begin{document}
Hello. This is my first TeX file in \LaTeX\

This is a newline\\
This is a newline of a new paragraph.

The formula for a square is $Area=x^2$
\end{document}
```

1. **\documentclass[11pt]{article}**  
   This line specifies the document class, which determines the overall layout of the document. The `[11pt]` option sets the font size to 11 points. The `{article}` class is commonly used for shorter documents like articles, reports, and essays.

2. **\begin{document}**  
   This marks the beginning of the document content. Everything after this command is considered part of the document and will be included in the output.

3. **Hello. This is my first TeX file in \LaTeX\**  
   This is a simple text line that will be displayed as "Hello. This is my first TeX file in LaTeX". The `\LaTeX\` command renders the word "LaTeX" in a special stylized format that is typically used to refer to the typesetting system.

4. **This is a newline\\**  
   The double backslash `\\` is used to insert a line break. The text following this command will be on a new line.

5. **This is a newline of a new paragraph.**  
   This is a continuation of the text after the line break. Since it follows the `\\` command, it appears on a new line.

6. **The formula for a square is $Area=x^2$**  
   This line includes an inline mathematical expression. The dollar signs `$...$` indicate that the content within them should be typeset as a mathematical formula. The formula "Area = xÂ²" will be displayed in the output.

7. **\end{document}**  
   This marks the end of the document. LaTeX will stop processing at this point.
