# Detailed Explanation of the LaTeX Code

This LaTeX code uses the `tikz` package to create a plot with multiple functions, an axis system, and a grid. The figure includes three different functions plotted on the graph, each in a different color. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part of the code:

### 1. Document Class Declaration

```latex
\documentclass{article}
```
This specifies the type of document, which in this case is an `article`. The `article` class is commonly used for academic papers, reports, and other text-heavy documents.

### 2. TikZ Package Inclusion

```latex
\usepackage{tikz}
```
This line includes the `tikz` package, which allows for the creation of high-quality graphics, plots, and figures in LaTeX.

### 3. Beginning the Document

```latex
\begin{document}
```
This marks the start of the document content. Everything after this command will be part of the body of the document.

### 4. Starting the TikZ Picture

```latex
%\begin{tikzpicture}[domain = 0:6]
\begin{tikzpicture}
```
The `\begin{tikzpicture}` command begins the `tikzpicture` environment where the plotting and drawing commands are placed. The commented-out line with `domain = 0:6` suggests that the author originally intended to limit the domain of some plots but decided not to.

### 5. Drawing the X and Y Axes

#### X-Axis

```latex
\draw[<->,ultra thick] (-2,0) -- (10,0)node[right] {X-Axis};
```
This command draws the X-axis. The `[<->]` option indicates that the axis will have arrows at both ends. The line starts at `(-2,0)` and ends at `(10,0)`, and the `node[right] {X-Axis}` places the label "X-Axis" on the right end of the axis. The `ultra thick` option makes the axis line thicker than normal.

#### Y-Axis

```latex
\draw[<->,ultra thick] (0,-2) -- (0,6) node[above] {Y-Axis};
```
This command draws the Y-axis. Like the X-axis, it has arrows at both ends and is drawn from `(0,-2)` to `(0,6)`. The label "Y-Axis" is placed at the top end of the axis, and the line is also `ultra thick`.

### 6. Drawing the Grid

```latex
\draw[gray, ultra thin] (-3,-3) grid (9.9,5.9);
```
This command draws a grid in the background to make the plot easier to read. The grid starts from `(-3,-3)` and extends to `(9.9,5.9)`. The grid lines are `gray` and `ultra thin`, ensuring that they do not overpower the main plot lines.

### 7. Plotting Functions

#### Plot of \( y = 2x \) (Orange Line)

```latex
\draw[domain=0:3,thick,orange,->] plot(\x,\x*2) node[above]{$y = 2x$};
```
This command plots the function \( y = 2x \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3 \). The `[thick,orange,->]` option ensures the line is thick, colored orange, and has an arrow at the end. The `plot(\x,\x*2)` part calculates \( y \) for each value of \( x \) according to the function \( y = 2x \). The `node[above]{$y = 2x$}` places the label for the line above the plotted function.

#### Plot of \( y = 4x^2 \) (Blue Parabola)

```latex
\draw[domain = -1.5:1.5,thick,blue] plot(\x,{4*\x*\x}) node[left]{$y=4x^2$};
```
This command plots the parabola \( y = 4x^2 \) from \( x = -1.5 \) to \( x = 1.5 \). The line is thick and blue, and the `plot(\x,{4*\x*\x})` calculates \( y \) based on the quadratic function \( y = 4x^2 \). The label `y = 4x^2` is placed to the left of the plotted curve using `node[left]`.

#### Plot of \( y = x + 1 \) (Green Line)

```latex
\draw[domain = -1:5,thick,green] plot(\x,{\x+1}) node[above]{$y=x+1$};
```
This command plots the function \( y = x + 1 \) from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 5 \). The line is thick and green, and the `plot(\x,{\x+1})` calculates \( y \) as \( x + 1 \) for each value of \( x \). The label `y = x + 1` is placed above the line using `node[above]`.

### 8. Ending the TikZ Picture and Document

```latex
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
These commands close the `tikzpicture` environment and the document, respectively.

### Final Output
- The figure consists of:
  - X and Y axes, both labeled and extending beyond the plot's limits.
  - A background grid for better readability.
  - Three plotted functions:
    - \( y = 2x \) as an orange line with an arrow.
    - \( y = 4x^2 \) as a blue parabola.
    - \( y = x + 1 \) as a green line.
  - Each function has a label indicating its equation.

In summary, this LaTeX code generates a graph with multiple functions plotted on a grid, clearly showing the relationships between variables on the X and Y axes.
